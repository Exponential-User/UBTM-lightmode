If you want to insert it, Follow the instructions included with the file named **`Instructions.txt`**

These are just Changes, There are something special like the shadows and transtions.


- The Dark Mode mod is buggy, I'll find a fix for it soon or later. (Dark Mode is only for VIP members of blacktanks)

## If the Owner of Blocktanks or Karate Fox Studios Does not want this:
DM me on discord: exponentialuser (#4457)
So i can take the mod off of github.

# IMPORTANT!! : This only works on .Net not .io
* I'll make it work, But I'll focus on this for now, [Bloacktanks.net](https://blocktanks.io "Blocktanks.net")
* I'll make a separate Repo for the .io soon or later, I don't know but we'll see.
