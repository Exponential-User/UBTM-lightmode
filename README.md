If you want to insert it, Follow the instructions included with the file named **`Instructions.txt`**

These are just Changes, There is something special like the shadows and transitions.


- The Dark Mode mod is buggy, I'll find a fix for it soon or later. (Dark Mode is only for VIP members of Blacktanks)

## If the Owner of Blocktanks or Karate Fox Studios Does not want this:
DM me on discord: exponentialuser (#4457)
So I can take this mod off of github.

### This only works on .Net, not .io, I'll make a .io if you don't want to change it to .io.
